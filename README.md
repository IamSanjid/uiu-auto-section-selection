## UIU Auto Section Selection
A simple rust app which connects to the Ucam cloud web server and selects specified section for the selected courses.

## TODO
* Make it configurable automatically through some sort of config file(eg. `.toml` or `.json`)
* Add more strategy when a section selection fails, should we retry, maybe add some more delay, or maybe delay smartly?
